            <p>My name is Oluwaferanmi Anjoolaoluwa Asiwaju(In order of first,middle and last name), I was born on the 25th of May 2003, which makes me 20 years of age.
                For as long as I can remember I have always been intrigued by computers and how they function
                and that has lead to various schools to work on my skills after mastering Basic computer operations, the next on my list is programming.
                I was referred to ALT school by a friend of mine who completed her program the previous set, I chose Alt school because I had a physical 
                example of how good your student could become. </p>
